# addinex-test

In total, where around 7 hrs, dusting off my node.js, mongoose, mongodb, react,
frontend stuff (like material UI for looking goood üòâ and sagas skills, getting
back on track with tooling npm, npx, etc...getting to know more about sagas,
specially in the form of react-redux-sagas + new stuff on next.js, well,
it's been fun! üòÅ

I actually found about `saga-slice`, tried to make it work (those where about
2 hrs) and in the end found about what blocked me so much to get it up and
running was the SSR of next.js, so FYI, works only in client mode because
there's a dependency around it where it calls `window` and that's only on
client-side mode, I could dive in the code of saga-slice and make a
`window == undefined` guard but as right now I don't know what would that
entail, anyways, maybe tech debt? Because saga-slice seems cool, like with
it's plugins to do CRUD like almost automatically also with the Axios
plugin `createApi`, and seems nuts, in a good way.

I hope this will be enough to get to know how I love to dive in and develop
stuff, and I'm eager to belong to the AddinexTech team!
